# Data Mining 1 Project
# IBM-HR Attrition

Tasks of the project:
1. **Data Understanding:** Explore the dataset with the analytical tools assessing data quality, the distribution of the variables and the pairwise correlations. 
2. **Clustering analysis:** Explore the dataset using various clustering techniques: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.
3. **Classification:** Explore the dataset using classification models: Decision Tree & KNN.
4. **Association Rules:** Explore the dataset using frequent pattern mining and association rules extraction. Then those are used to predict the target variable.
